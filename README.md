If the schema changes:
`lein run migrate`

## Thoughts

Bind is one way with datascript.
Reactions are cool for propigating change, but what about pushing change?
Om-next will be awesome.


## Deployment

`./bin/deploy-dev.sh` to deploy to staging

Deployment to production happens on any merge to master branch
